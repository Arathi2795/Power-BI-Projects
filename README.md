SALES INSIGHT 

This case study is based on a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market. 

A sales report is an analysis tool that provides insights into the performance of various sales activities within a company. 
Armed with powerful KPIs these reports used to find trends and insights to improve the quality of their products and services.
In this project, we can see how to maintain revenue and management under control with the help of interactive charts that consolidate data 
from our connected database and bring out powerful visualizations that tell an immediate data story. 

Here we break down the costs, monitor the incremental sales, and compare the results with the previous months while keeping data up-to-date.

We can extract actionable insights and identify where they could be improved.
